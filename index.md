## Welcome to AdvanceSource

You can download the source code and can build your own django multiplayer games site template but in order to host you need to purchase reddis sever.

This is a free website template for all of you and you can commit changes into it in order to build your site. This site is built by [OpenSource](https://osourcegames.firebaseapp.com)

### AdvanceSource

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/abindent/advancesource/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
